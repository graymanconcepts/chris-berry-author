Editing is where the magic happens. Here’s how to transform your rough draft into something you’re proud of:

### 1. Take a Break
Distance gives perspective. Step away from your draft before revising.

### 2. Read Aloud
Hearing your words helps you catch awkward phrasing and errors.

### 3. Focus on Structure First
Fix big-picture issues (plot holes, pacing) before polishing sentences.

### 4. Trim the Excess
Cut unnecessary words, repetition, and tangents. Clarity is key.

### 5. Get Feedback
A fresh set of eyes can spot issues you’ve missed.

Editing isn’t just about fixing mistakes—it’s about making your writing the best it can be.
