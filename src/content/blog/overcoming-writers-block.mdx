Writer's block happens to everyone—but it doesn't have to stop you. Here are some proven ways to overcome it:

### 1. Change Your Environment
A new setting can spark fresh ideas. Try writing in a café, park, or different room.

### 2. Set Small Goals
Break your writing into manageable chunks. Even 100 words is progress!

### 3. Freewrite
Let go of expectations and write whatever comes to mind for 10 minutes. No editing allowed.

### 4. Take a Break
Sometimes stepping away is the best way to reset your creativity.

### 5. Revisit Your "Why"
Remind yourself why you started writing. Reconnect with your passion and purpose.

The key is persistence. Every writer faces blocks—what matters is pushing through them.
